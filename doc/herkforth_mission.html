    <h2>herkforth Mission</h2>

<p>My ultimate goal is to make [some] computers easy to use; to make them so that
with reasonable intelligence, diligence and training you can get the computer
to do just about anything.</p>

<p>I am accomplishing this goal by writing a programming language/environment from
scratch by combining some very effective concepts, some experimental ones that
look very promising and some of my own invention.</p>

<p>Many thanks particularly to <a href="chuck_moore.html">Chuck Moore</a>, <a href="jeff_fox.html">Jeff Fox</a> and <a href="jef_raskin.html">Jef Raskin</a>
for thinking outside the box, for their countless hours of experimentation, and
for taking the time to share.</p>

<p>I plan to accomplish this through the <a href="herkforth_goals.html">herkforth goals</a>.</p>
