    <h2>herkforth's bootstrapping process</h2>

<p>This page describes the <a href="herkforth.html">herkforth</a> rebuilds it's self. The word to do this
is called <code>bootstrap</code> (so you can see the source by typing <code>bootstrapD</code></p>

<p>Warning, this describes code that I'm in the middle of writing, it hasn't even
hit the repository yet as of this writing.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Herkforth creates an image of a new ELF file in memory at <code>here</code>, using
<code>w,</code> and <code>allot</code>. No binary code is preserved. This image is then written
out to a new file, and copied back down to the initial load address and
executed there.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<ul>
<li>Align on a 32 byte boundary. (So when subsequent pieces are aligned, they will
still be alligned then the whole thing is moved down to the load address.)</li>
<li>Append elf header, saving the addresses where various fields need to be filled
in later (the entry point, and the size of the file)</li>
<li>Append the source blocks. As the source is copied, mark which dictionary
entries are used (in a separate array.)</li>
<li>Padding (make room for more source blocks to be added.)</li>
<li>Next the dictionary is copied in. The following modifications are made as it is
copied:</li>
<li>1) If the entry was not used by a source token (as marked above) then that
dictionary entry is replaced by null bytes.</li>
<li>2) If the entry is a normal word (eg not a variable) then the CFA field is set
to zero.</li>
<li>3) If the entry is a variable, then the CFA field is updated so it will still
point to the variable_value field.</li>
<li>Padding (so the dictionary can expand)</li>
<li>Now data objects are copied. To accomplish this, loop through the new
dictionary, and for entries with the flags set to indicate a data word, copy
the data object pointed to by the CFA, and update the CFA.</li>
<li>Note: there is no padding after the data, because data objects are added on the
heap. (And are copied all to the same place as described above when you
bootstrap.)</li>
<li>Kernel words compiled.</li>
<li>The CFAs for the kernel words are copied and translated into the new dictionary.</li>
<li>initialization routine is compiled in. This sets up the registers to point to
the source blocks, dictionary, stacks etc, and then finishes by telling the
kernel to load block 0.</li>
<li>That's it for appending stuff.</li>
<li>Fix up the headers in the elf file (entry point, and file size).</li>
<li>Write out ELF to a new file</li>
<li>Now to copy the whole mess back to the initial load address ($10000000 on
linux) and execute it. But this isn't as easy as it sounds, because doing so
will overwrite the memory copy routine, etc.. So:</li>
<li>1) compile code (which does not call any existing code) to move the new image to the load address,</li>
<li>2) to flush the caches</li>
<li>3) branch to the new entry point</li>
<li>run it.</li>
</ul>
