    <h2>Getting started with herkforth</h2>

<p>You'll need to know at least a little about <a href="forth.html">forth</a> (and preferably
<a href="colorforth.html">colorforth</a> as well) for <a href="herkforth.html">herkforth</a> to make much sense. If you don't,
then you should first read one of the introductions on the <a href="forth_documentation.html">forth
documentation</a> page.</p>

<p>First <a href="build_herkforth.html">build herkforth</a></p>

<p>then type: <code>./herkforth000</code></p>

<p>enter a word or number and type ENTER (BTW, space will insert the word in the
current block and not execute it)</p>

<p>press SHIFT-Q to quit.</p>

<p>Now read how to use the <a href="herkforth_interface.html">herkforth interface</a></p>

<p>And finally you may want to know some <a href="herkforth_words.html">herkforth words</a></p>
