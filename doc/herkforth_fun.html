<p>This is a little solitaire-like game.</p>

<p>Go to block 110 and hit <code>shift-B</code></p>

<p>You'll see something along these lines:</p>

<pre>

 2  7  9 
10  6 10 
10  3  4  8  3  1 

</pre>

<p>This shows a grid of 9 numbers, and 3 more (&quot;8  3  1&quot; in this case) waiting to
come on the board.</p>

<p>The object is to get all the numbers to the top left corner.</p>

<p>You can move numbers up or left, one square at a time.</p>

<p>When you move a number it goes on top of another number (obliterating it.)</p>

<p>You can only move a number if the number you're moving, and the one you're
moving it on to are either the same, differ by 1 or differ by a multiple
of 3.</p>

<p>Examples of moves on the example board above:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could move the 3 up because it differes from the 6 by 3.</li>
<li>You can NOT move the three left because it differes from 10 by 7.</li>
<li>You can move the 4 up because it differs from 10 by 6. or left because it
differs from the 3 by 1.</li>
<li>You can move the 10 in the lower left up because they are the same number.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to move</h3>

<p>Moving is done by first choosing the piece you would like to move, then the
destination.</p>

<p>The way you choose a location on the board is by pressing the number on the
number pad that corresponds to that square on the board. The number pad is
layed out like this:</p>

<pre>

7  8  9
4  5  6
1  2  3

</pre>

<p>So if you want to select the top right square on the board, you press <code>9</code>. If
you want to select the middle square on the board press <code>5</code>. Bottm right is
<code>3</code>, etc..</p>

<h3>Other Keys</h3>

<p><code>shift-Q</code> to quit</p>

<p><code>r</code> to redeal (use when you win or get stuck... or if it just looks nasty)</p>

<p>P.S. if this isn't enough fun for you, you can get random bar graphs at block
104. Just load the block (<code>104 load</code>) and run <code>rnd-test</code>. Press a key to
get another. Press <code>shift-Q</code> to go back to the editor.</p>
