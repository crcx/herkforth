    <h2>herkforth Command Keys</h2>

<p>These are the keys you use to control the editor. Don't miss T and C.</p>

<p>You may notice that a lot of the keys are capital letters. So type your words
in lowercase, and your commands uppercase. Careful of the stupid caps lock.</p>

<pre>
MOVING AROUND

searching
T        move cursor to the definition of the word under the cursor
V        move cursor to next occurrence of word under cursor (new in repository)
D        go to the definition of the word you just typed on the input line (new in herkforth-0.4.1)
C        go back (after you've used E, T, V and/or D)

crawling
H        move cursor back
N        move cursor forward
{        edit previous block
}        edit next block
E        edit block whose number is on the input line (new in herkforth 0.6)


EXECUTING

&lt;enter&gt;  execute the word on the input line
B        run the whole current block through the interpreter
M        run the word under the cursor through the interpreter and advance cursor


EDITING

inserting
&lt;space&gt;  insert the text you've just typed after the cursor
[        change to yellow (execute color) *
]        change to green (compile color) *
:        define a word (red) *
'        define a constant (magenta) *
&amp;        define a variable (white) *
&quot;        define a persistent data object
U        undelete (paste the last word you deleted. FILO (stack). works nicely for cut and paste)

deleting
\              delete word under cursor (you can paste it back in with U (see above))
&lt;backspace&gt;    delete a charachter from the end of the input line

changing
R        rename the word under the cursor to what you've just typed on the input line
See also: color changes above (under inserting)


MISC.
$        (not really a command) start hex numbers with $
S        bootstrap and save. This compiles a forth kernel and saves that, the
               dictionary, data, and source to a new elf
Q        quit
ctrl-L   redraw the screen

</pre>

<p>* Note about switching colors: To enter a word in a color other than space
would give you (as indicated by the colored cell in the bottom left of the
screen) type the word, then hit the key for that color. Pressing a color key
with nothing on the input line will change the color of the word under the
cursor. Warning: changing a word to a different type (eg a red word (normal
word) to a magenta (constant)) will likely yield unexpected (and probably
unpleasant) results. This may be addressed in future versions.</p>

<p>Note: there is no key for <a href="herkforth_export_source.html">herkforth export-source</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like another source block to play with, just type &quot;new-block&quot; (without
quotes) and press ENTER. This will give you a (nearly) empty block after the
others.</p>
