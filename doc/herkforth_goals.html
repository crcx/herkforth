    <h2>Herkforth goals</h2>

<p><a href="herkforth.html">herkforth</a> has the following goals in order to realize the
<a href="herkforth_mission.html">herkforth mission</a>:</p>

<p>My basic stratagy is to first make an environment that is easy to program in,
and use that to create a productive, useful, fun system. -- <a href="jason_woofenden.html">Jason Woofenden</a></p>

<p>Here's my plan of atack:</p>

<p>Create an operating system for Apple hardware with OpenFirmware. The major
features of this system will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Useful in real life</li>
<li>Easy to create good software</li>
<li>Elegant: keep it simple, small and fast</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important ones are on top, and the ones that will happen first are at
the bottom.</p>

<p>By &quot;good software&quot; and &quot;easy to use&quot; I mean that the software make it easy to
become quite proficient at getting your work done. I hold dear the values
presented in <a href="the_humane_interface.html">The Humane Interface</a> by <a href="jeff_raskin.html">Jeff Raskin</a> such as habituation,
visibility, monotony, key efficiency, etc..</p>

<p>herkforth os will have the following programs early on:</p>

<ul>
<li>programming environment (exists but needs rework)</li>
<li>email client</li>
<li>ssh client</li>
<li>web browser</li>
<li>irc</li>
</ul>
