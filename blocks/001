Please read doc/editor   Shift-Q to quit

This block is just to hold definitions that say what blocks things are in, and
make words to (re)load them. This is as close to a file system as I get so far.

the "1 2 3 4 5" is there so we can check that we can easily spot stack errors
(when the editor starts up, check that these elements are still on the top of
the stack.)
