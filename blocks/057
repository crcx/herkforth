entry point

_start is the entry point for the ELF. It initializes the registers, then
starts compiling the blocks (skipping the bootstrapper of course.)

_start initializes the registers pointing to the dictionary and such which come
after _start in the memory. therefor we must decide where the end of the code
section is before compiling _start. and then put those other sections
(dictionary, data, stacks) exactly where we decided.
