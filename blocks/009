Assembler

These are pretty straight,forward. put the parameters for the mnemonic on the
stack, then call one of these words.

Note: for load and store instructions that take an immediate offset, the
immediate is passed on top of the stack (not in the middle as it appears in
standard asm syntax)

please see doc/asm for more details.
