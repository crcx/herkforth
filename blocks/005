Assembler: bitfields

These are all the words 

opcode starts a new instruction with one opcode
2opcode starts assembling a new instruction with a seccondary opcode (pass primary on top of stack)
|51 |52 |53 |54 |55 or in five bit field 1-5
|16 or in 16 bit field
|26 or in 26 bit field
|s10 or in a 10 bit field with the at bit 11 with the halves swaped as for mfspr
|rc set the rc bit

_5-5-16 assemble an instruction with two five bit fields and a 16 bit field
_l5-5-16 assemble an instruction with two five bit fields and a 16 bit field (first fields are swapped as in logical instructions)
_5-5-5 assemble an instruction with three five bit fields
_l5-5-5 assemble an instruction with three five bit fields (first fields are swapped as in logical instructions)
_5-s10 assemble an instruction with a five bit fields and a swapped 10 bit field
_5-5 assemble an instruction with two five bit fields
