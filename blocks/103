Some code I'm experimenting with.

In case you're interested, Here's how you might be able to get the screensaver thing to work:

first create a link to the frame buffer called "fb" in the current directory:

for example:

$ ln -s /dev/fb/0 fb

then change the count in the "loop" word to the number of bytes of pixels you
have on your screen devided by 4.

Then execute the current block by typing a capital B


I was playing around to define tic and defer. they seem to work, but I don't
really have a use for them so they are sitting around here.
